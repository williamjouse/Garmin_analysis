# Analysis of Activities from Garmin Connect Using Python

A [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) that analyzes running activities from the Garmin Connect app.

## Description

The notebook holds an exploratory data analysis to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their
main characteristics, employing data visualization methods and descriptive statistics.

Initially, we acquired the data from the Garmin Connect app and cleaned it. In the following, we presented some questions 
that we want to answer them. The final part, we implemented an exploratory data analysis and answered the questions.
